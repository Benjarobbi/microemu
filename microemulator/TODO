1. javax.microedition.io.* supported (mostly done, extensive testing needed)
  bug in IE not working HttpConnection - URLConnection used - check closing connetions

2. rebuild InputMethod to extend functionality:
  - respond to typing on computer keyboard
  - switching between modes (123, abc, ABC, password, URL, etc.)
  - solve problem with VK_BACKSPACE key on emulator device

3. extended web site with overview, faq section, instalation instructions, etc.

4. there is bug in NanoXML with parsing (locate details and send issue to author)

5. two classes from java.util.* are from GNU Classpath which is GPL with exception
(i'm not sure if can be used in LGPL MicroEmulator)

6. (?) applet loader - during loading applet code progress bar should be visible

7. obfuscator for applet: maybe LGPL Retroguard, applet jar should be 
reduced to 175KB, i hope
