MicroEmulator

J2ME Device Emulator is pure Java implementation of J2ME in J2SE.
It allows demonstrate MIDlet (MIDP/CLDC) based applications as a
standalone Java application or as web browser applet.

Requirements:
 - J2SE 1.3+

There are two methods of running apps in emulator:

1. As an application:
a) java org.microemu.app.Main (MIDlet application main class)
or, java org.microemu.app.Main (MIDlet jad file)

 - me-app.jar must be in CLASSPATH

b) java -jar me-app.jar (MIDlet application main class)
or, java -jar me-app.jar (MIDlet jad file)

 - (MIDlet application main class) parameter is optional, if used MIDlet
   application jar file must be in CLASSPATH,
 - (MIDlet jad file) must have .jad extension,
 - for Nokia UI support include nokiaui.jar to the CLASSPATH,
 - for Siemens API support include siemensapi.jar to the CLASSPATH.


2. In applet:
Including html code:
<applet code="org.microemu.applet.Main"
		width=226 height=471 archive="me-applet.jar,(MIDlet application jar)">
	<param name="midlet" value="(MIDlet application main class)">
</applet>

 - for Nokia UI support include nokiaui.jar to the archive attribute,
 - for Siemens API support include siemensapi.jar to the archive attribute.

There is additional parameter in applet definition tag if you want start applet
with another device than default:
  <param name="device" value="({midlet class name} | {jad file location})">
    eg. minimum phone included in distribution has
        org/microemu/device/minimum/device.xml

and remember to include new device jar into applet archive tag
    eg. minimum phone included in distribution has
        minimum.jar

Example for SimpleDemo MIDlet, Nokia UI support and Minimum device:
<applet code="org.microemu.applet.Main"
		width=157 height=285 archive="me-applet.jar,nokiaui.jar,minimum.jar,simpledemo.jar">
	<param name="midlet" value="org.microemu.midp.examples.simpledemo.SimpleDemo">
	<param name="device" value="org/microemu/device/minimum/device.xml">
</applet>
