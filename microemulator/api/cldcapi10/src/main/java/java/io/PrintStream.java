 * A <code>PrintStream</code> adds functionality to another output stream,
 * namely the ability to print representations of various data values
 * conveniently.  Two other features are provided as well.  Unlike other output
 * streams, a <code>PrintStream</code> never throws an
 * <code>IOException</code>; instead, exceptional situations merely set an
 * internal flag that can be tested via the <code>checkError</code> method.
 * Optionally, a <code>PrintStream</code> can be created so as to flush
 * automatically; this means that the <code>flush</code> method is
 * automatically invoked after a byte array is written, one of the
 * <code>println</code> methods is invoked, or a newline character or byte
 * (<code>'\n'</code>) is written.
 *
 * <p> All characters printed by a <code>PrintStream</code> are converted into
 * bytes using the platform's default character encoding.
