* javax.microedition.io.* supported (mostly done, extensive testing needed)
  bug in IE not working HttpConnection - URLConnection used - check closing connetions

* rebuild InputMethod to extend functionality:
  - switching between modes (numeric, password, URL, etc.)
  - solve problem with VK_BACKSPACE key on emulator device

* extended web site with overview, faq section, instalation instructions, etc.

(i'm not sure if can be used in LGPL MicroEmulator)
