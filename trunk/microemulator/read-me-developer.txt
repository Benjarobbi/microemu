* Build

   We are using maven2 to build project

    To build project you need this environment variables:
    JAVA_HOME, SWT_HOME (to build swt module) and WTK_HOME to compile and test MIDlets

   To create Eclipse projects run:
     mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true

   To run build without tests:
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true

* error classpath configuration error, Wrong Injected class detected. microemu-injected module should be after microemu-javase in eclipse

  This is the problem that order of dependancies in maven is undefined.

  To solve: In eclipse edit project  microemu-javase-swing  move microemu-injected down.

  In fact it should not even be there as project (bug in maven-eclipse plugin), only jar microemu-injected-2.0.1-SNAPSHOT-inject.jar is required!
  The best option to remove this dependacncy from eclipse project.


* Building applet

  This describe procedure for building applet.

  We run proguard 3 times with deferent options
   on microemu-cldc and microemu-midp we need to preserve all API declarations
   on microemu-javase+microemu-javase-swing assembly we just need to preserve main applet class.
