* Build

   We are using maven2 to build project

    To build project you need this environment variables:
    JAVA_HOME, SWT_HOME (to build swt module) and WTK_HOME to compile and test MIDlets

   To create Eclipse projects run:
     mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true

   To run build without tests:
     mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true


* Building applet

  This describe procedure for building applet.

  We run proguard 3 times with deferent options
   on microemu-cldc and microemu-midp we need to preserve all API declarations
   on microemu-javase+microemu-javase-swing assembly we just need to preserve main applet class.
