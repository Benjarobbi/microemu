* in javax.microedition.io.* only http supported - there is tcp, udp and https needed

* rebuild InputMethod to extend functionality:
  - switching between modes (numeric, password, URL, etc.)
  - solve problem with VK_BACKSPACE key on emulator device

* extended web site with overview, faq section, instalation instructions, etc.

* two classes from java.util.* are from GNU Classpath which is GPL with exception
(i'm not sure if can be used in LGPL MicroEmulator)

* (?) applet loader - during loading applet code progress bar should be visible

* obfuscator for applet: maybe LGPL Retroguard, applet jar could be 
reduced to 175KB, i hope
